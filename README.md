# Memory-Heirarchy
Here a memory sub-system was added to the previously implemented single-cycle CPU. Refer to [Simple-Processor](https://github.com/PiyumaliSandunika/Simple-Processor.git)

This was done as a part of the Lab in CO224 Computer Architecture course


## Part 1 - Data Memory
Here 256 Byte Data Memory module was connected to the CPU that previously built.

## Part 2 - Data Cache 
Here we implemented a simple data cache to reduce the time spent on accessing memory for most accesses based on locality.

## Part 3 - Instruction Cache and Memory
An instruction cache and an instruction memory were added to the system.
